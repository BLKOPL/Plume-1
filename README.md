## Plume

**Plume** is a social skill sharing application that allows users to match and connect with others who possess a skill that they are interested in. Users are able to browse a deck of potential skill matches, and can choose to interact with them by liking their profiles.

Once both users "like" each other, they can begin to message and arrange the terms of their skill exchange.
